ESP32 NUT Server Project Summary & Future Prompt
==================================================

**Project Purpose:**
- ESP32-S3 firmware acting as a NUT (Network UPS Tools) server for CyberPower UPS (VP700ELCD/VP1000ELCD) via USB HID.
- Integrates with Home Assistant for real-time UPS monitoring.

**Hardware:**
- ESP32-S3 dev board (USB-OTG capable)
- CyberPower UPS (tested: VP700ELCD)
- RGB LED for status indication

**Key Features Implemented:**
- USB HID parsing for CyberPower UPS (17 data fields, 13 report types)
- State management for UPS connection and data freshness
- TCP server serving NUT protocol (port 3493), Home Assistant compatible
- Real-time logging and robust error handling
- LED status system: green (all good), yellow (partial issue), red (critical), white pulse (data activity)
- Secure WiFi credential management (wifi_secrets.h, gitignored)
- Clean git workflow (feature branches, merges, history cleaning)
- README and codebase fully documented

**Current Status:**
- System is production-ready and running in a real environment
- All features above are working and tested
- LED status system is live and provides accurate feedback
- Home Assistant integration is stable

**Next Steps (for future sessions):**
- Add a webserver for remote monitoring and configuration (including WiFi credentials)
- Refine/calibrate UPS value parsing for even more accuracy
- (Optional) Add more advanced features or UI improvements

**Special Notes:**
- Security incident with WiFi credentials was resolved and history cleaned
- All code and documentation are up to date and in sync with GitHub

**Prompt to use for future sessions:**

"I am working on an ESP32-S3 firmware project that acts as a NUT server for CyberPower UPS devices (via USB HID) and integrates with Home Assistant. The project already has:
- Full USB HID parsing for CyberPower (17 fields, 13 reports)
- TCP NUT server (port 3493), Home Assistant compatible
- Robust WiFi management (with wifi_secrets.h)
- A comprehensive LED status system (green/yellow/red/white pulse)
- Secure credential handling and clean git history
- All code and documentation up to date and in sync

The system is running in production and works well. Next, I want to add a webserver for remote monitoring and configuration (including WiFi credentials), and possibly refine the UPS value parsing. Please pick up from here, and ask if you need any more details."
